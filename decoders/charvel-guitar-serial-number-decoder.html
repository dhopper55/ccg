      <div class="decoder-modal-body">
        <p>Charvel guitar serial numbers vary significantly by era and factory, with modern (2013‑present) models using a 10‑digit code where the first two digits indicate the year (e.g., ICJ1500001 is 2015). Earlier Japanese models often start with a number representing the year (e.g., “8” for 1988), while older US models feature 4–6 digit codes on the neck plate.</p>

        <h3>Here is how to decode Charvel serial numbers based on era and origin</h3>
        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>Modern Models (2013–Present):</strong> 10‑digit serials usually located on the back of the headstock. The first two digits are the year (e.g., 15 = 2015, 16 = 2016).</li>
          <li><strong>Made in Mexico (MIM):</strong> Typically feature “MC” or “MX” at the beginning, indicating Mexico, followed by the year.</li>
          <li><strong>Japanese Charvels (1986–1990s):</strong> Often have 6 digits. Early Japanese models (Model Series) had serial numbers starting with “0” for the first year (1986) and increasing subsequently.</li>
          <li><strong>USA Charvels (Pre‑Production/1980s):</strong> Early models (San Dimas) often feature a 4‑digit number stamped on a neck plate that also includes a P.O. Box address.</li>
          <li><strong>USA/Custom Shop (Modern):</strong> Stamped at the end of the fingerboard for neck‑through models, or on the neck plate for bolt‑ons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Indicators</h3>
        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>Prefix Letters:</strong> Can indicate the series or factory, such as “C” for custom, “MC” for Mexico.</li>
          <li><strong>Neck Plate:</strong> Often used on older or bolt‑on models.</li>
          <li><strong>Neck Heel:</strong> Sometimes, serial numbers or production dates are written on the neck heel, requiring the neck to be removed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="decoder-modal-note">For specific, hard‑to‑identify models, using the <a href="https://www.charvel.com/support/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charvel Guitars support FAQ</a> or reaching out to their customer support is the most reliable method.</p>
