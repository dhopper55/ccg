        <p>Music Man guitar serial numbers, primarily for post‑1980s models, are generally found on the back of the headstock or the bridge and follow a format of one or two letters followed by 5–6 digits, often requiring a lookup in the Ernie Ball database for exact dating. The letter often corresponds to the model, while the numbers are typically sequential and do not directly encode the date.</p>

        <h3>Here is how to decode and find Music Man serial numbers</h3>
        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>Best Tool:</strong> Use the official Music Man Serial Number Database for instruments made in San Luis Obispo, CA.</li>
          <li><strong>What the Database Covers:</strong> Generally, Ernie Ball Music Man instruments from the late 80s to the present.</li>
          <li><strong>What it Does NOT Cover:</strong> OLP, Sterling by Music Man, and older pre‑EB (1970s–early 80s) instruments.</li>
          <li><strong>Location:</strong> Primarily on the bridge or the back of the headstock.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Decoding by Era</h3>
        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>Modern (Late 1980s – Present):</strong> Serial numbers often start with a letter (e.g., G, F, A) followed by 5 or 6 digits. The letters sometimes indicate the model, but the numbers are largely sequential.</li>
          <li><strong>Pre‑Ernie Ball (Mid‑1970s – 1984):</strong> These often start with “B” followed by 5 digits (e.g., B0xxxxx). For these, you may need to remove the neck to find the date stamped on the heel or in the neck pocket.</li>
          <li><strong>Sterling by Music Man:</strong> Serial numbers on these imports usually do not work with the EBMM database. They often follow a year‑coded format, where the first two digits might indicate the year (e.g., 10xxxx = 2010).</li>
