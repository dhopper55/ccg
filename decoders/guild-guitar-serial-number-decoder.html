      <p class="brand-description">Founded in 1952 in New York City by Alfred Dronge and George Mann, Guild Guitars established a reputation for high-quality, player-focused instruments, particularly favored by jazz musicians and later, folk artists. Known for robust dreadnoughts and industry-standard 12-string guitars, the company moved to New Jersey in the 1950s and has since passed through various owners, including Fender, before being acquired by Cordoba Music Group in 2014, and subsequently Yamaha Guitar Group in 2023.<br><a href="#" class="decoder-howto-link" data-modal-target="howto-guild">(How to decode a Guild serial #)</a></p>

      </div>
      <div class="decoder-modal-body">
        <p>Guild guitar serial numbers are generally found on the back of the headstock or inside the soundhole, with decoding methods varying significantly by era. Earlier models (1950s–1970s) typically rely on production date charts, while modern, US‑made Guilds often use a letter prefix for the decade and a subsequent number for the year.</p>

        <h3>Key Eras and Decoding Tips</h3>
        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>1952–1960s:</strong> Serial numbers are sequential; for example, 1953 began around 1000, 1956 around 3000, and 1959 around 4000.</li>
          <li><strong>1965–1969:</strong> Separate, model‑specific serial numbering systems were often used.</li>
          <li><strong>1970–1979:</strong> Guild Guitars provides annual range charts (e.g., 1970: 46696–50978).</li>
          <li><strong>1979–1983:</strong> Returned to model‑specific prefixes.</li>
          <li><strong>Modern US‑Made:</strong> Often, the first letter indicates the decade, followed by numbers for the year.</li>
          <li><strong>Other Potential Formats:</strong> Some serials may feature a letter (factory code), followed by two digits for the year, and a production number.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="decoder-modal-note">For the most accurate identification, it is recommended to check the Guild Guitars website directly for their detailed dating guides.</p>
