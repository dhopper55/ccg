      </div>
      <div class="decoder-modal-body">
        <p>Ovation guitar serial numbers, typically found on a label inside the soundhole or stamped on the headstock, are primarily decoded by identifying the first letter (decade) and subsequent numbers (year) for US models. Dedicated databases like OvationTribute.com are recommended for accurate dating, as formats varied between eras and international models.</p>

        <h3>Decoding US Ovation Serial Numbers</h3>
        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>Decade Letter:</strong> The serial number usually begins with a letter indicating the decade (e.g., C for 1970s, E for 1980s, F/G for 1990s).</li>
          <li><strong>Year Digit:</strong> Following the letter, the first number often indicates the specific year within that decade.</li>
          <li><strong>Location:</strong> Most USA‑made Ovation serial numbers are found on a paper label inside the bowl, visible through the soundhole.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>OvationTribute.com:</strong> This site is considered the primary resource for decoding serial numbers, providing lists to track production dates.</li>
          <li><strong>Foreign/Celebrity Models:</strong> Ovation guitars made outside the USA (such as Celebrity models) often do not follow the standard US serial number format, making them harder to trace.</li>
          <li><strong>Adamas/Special Series:</strong> These often have unique serial number sequences that require specific documentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Label Information:</strong> If a paper label is missing, the serial number might be stamped on the back of the headstock.</li>
