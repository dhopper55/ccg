      <div class="decoder-modal-body">
        <p>Dean Guitars serial numbers are typically found on the back of the headstock, with USA models often featuring a 7‑digit number where the first two digits represent the year (e.g., “05”XXXXX for 2005). In the late 1990s, USA models were sometimes stamped on the fretboard. Import (Korean/Chinese) models often have less consistent numbering, often starting with a letter representing the factory or month.</p>

        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>USA Models:</strong> Usually 7 digits. The first two digits are the year (e.g., 05XXXXX = 2005). Some mid‑90s models have the serial number stamped on the end of the fretboard.</li>
          <li><strong>Import Models (Korean):</strong> Often start with a letter followed by 6–7 digits (e.g., E7XXXXX). These are harder to date, as they often do not follow a strict year‑first pattern, though some may indicate the year in the first or second digit.</li>
          <li><strong>12‑String Basses:</strong> Often follow a format of “E” + 6 digits (2000–2005), “US” + 8 digits (2006–2015), or “WK” + 8 digits (2017–2018).</li>
          <li><strong>Czech Republic Models:</strong> Often labeled “Hand Crafted in the Czech Republic” on the back of the headstock, but typically lack year‑identifying serial numbers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="decoder-modal-note">If the serial number is ambiguous, checking for “Made in USA” or “Hand Crafted” on the headstock is the first step, as import models generally do not follow a consistent, easily decoded date formula.</p>
