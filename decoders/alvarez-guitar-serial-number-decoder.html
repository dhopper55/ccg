        <p>Alvarez guitars can be dated by checking the serial number, typically found on the headstock or a label inside the soundhole. Modern Alvarez guitars (post‑2000) often use an 8–9 digit code starting with a letter, while Alvarez‑Yairi models use a 4–5 digit stamp on the neck heel‑block, sometimes employing Japanese “Emperor” dating codes.</p>

        <h3>Decoding Alvarez Serial Numbers</h3>
        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>Modern Alvarez (Post‑2000):</strong> These generally follow a format where the letter indicates the factory, and the following numbers relate to the production date. A common format is a letter followed by 8 or 9 digits, where the first two digits often indicate the year, or the last two indicate the year, depending on the model.</li>
          <li><strong>Alvarez‑Yairi (Vintage/Handmade):</strong> These usually have a 4 or 5‑digit number stamped on the internal neck heel‑block.</li>
          <li><strong>Pre‑2000s:</strong> These often use the Japanese Emperor dating system. The first two digits indicate the year of the Emperor’s reign (e.g., 51xxxx = 1976, which is the 51st year of the Showa era).</li>
          <li><strong>Post‑2000:</strong> The Yairi factory shifted to a more standard system, often directly reflecting the year.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Identify Your Guitar</h3>
        <ul class="decoder-howto-steps">
          <li><strong>Locate the Number:</strong> Look for a stamped number on the neck heel‑block inside the soundhole (common on Yairi) or a label on the back of the headstock.</li>
          <li><strong>Use the Official Tool:</strong> The Alvarez Guitars website has a dedicated date finder and serial number checker for models built in 2000 or later.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact Support:</strong> For older Yairi models, the best method is to use the official Alvarez contact form to get accurate, direct information from them.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="decoder-modal-note">Disclaimer: Due to various production eras and manufacturing locations (Japan, Korea, China), serial number formats can vary, making the official lookup tool the most reliable method.</p>
