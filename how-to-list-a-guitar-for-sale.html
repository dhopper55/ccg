      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Gather all relevant details</h2>
      <p>Start with the basics: <strong>brand</strong>, <strong>model</strong>, and <strong>year</strong> (if you can confirm it). Buyers want to know exactly what they’re looking at, and accurate details help you price correctly.</p>
      <div class="listing-callout">
        <p>Serial numbers can confirm factory and year. Our decoder hub covers <strong>20+ major brands</strong>.</p>

      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Photos Are Your Biggest Sales Tool</h2>
      <p>The most valuable thing you can do is take <strong>lots of clear, well-lit photos</strong>. Don’t just show the body — document the entire instrument and the details buyers ask about most.</p>
      <ul class="listing-checklist">
        <li>Full front and back of the body</li>
        <li>Neck front and back (with a clear shot down the fretboard)</li>
        <li>Headstock front and back</li>
        <li>Hardware close-ups (bridge, tuners, pickups, controls)</li>
        <li>Serial number and any labels</li>
        <li>Areas prone to damage (corners, headstock tips, binding)</li>
        <li>Case or gig bag inside/outside, plus any included accessories</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="listing-note">Photos are extremely important on marketplaces like <a class="listing-link" href="https://reverb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reverb.com</a>. Buyers are essentially making a decision based on what they see in the images and what you describe, so clarity and detail matter.</p>
      <p class="listing-note">If you’re unsure what a complete set looks like, aim for more angles than you think you need. Extra photos reduce buyer questions and speed up the sale.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section">
      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Make Your Photos Look Professional (Without Fancy Gear)</h2>
      <p>Great photos don’t require a studio. Consistent lighting and a clean background do most of the work. <a class="listing-link" href="https://help.reverb.com/hc/en-us/articles/41988294779291-Listing-Standards-Images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reverb.com listing guidelines</a> emphasize that photos should be in-focus, well-lit, and show the full instrument from multiple angles. If you’re shooting indoors, use indirect daylight or multiple lamps to reduce harsh shadows. A neutral wall or sheet keeps attention on the guitar. A simple tripod helps avoid blur.</p>
      <p>On platforms like <a class="listing-link" href="https://reverb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reverb.com</a>, square-cropped photos work best and the first image becomes your primary thumbnail — make it the clearest, most complete shot of the guitar.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section">
      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Add a Short Demo Video</h2>
      <p>Video builds trust quickly. A simple phone clip showing clean chords, pickup switching, and a few lead lines can eliminate buyer hesitation. <a class="listing-link" href="https://reverb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reverb.com</a> listings even allow a YouTube link directly under the photo uploader.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section">
      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Disclose Every Flaw Up Front</h2>
      <p>Transparency saves time. Mention all wear, cracks, repairs, or electronics issues. If a toggle switch is intermittent or a knob is missing, call it out and include a close-up photo. Buyers are much more comfortable when you describe issues openly — and it protects you from returns or disputes later.</p>
      <p>If there’s a straightforward fix, note it. For example: “Toggle switch is flaky — likely needs a replacement switch.” This shows you understand the issue and helps the buyer budget for it.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section">
      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Collector-Grade vs. Player-Grade Listings</h2>
      <p>Collector buyers typically expect <strong>near-mint condition</strong> and all-original parts. For those listings, be extra precise about originality and cosmetics.</p>
      <p>Player-grade guitars can sell well if you emphasize <strong>playability</strong>: stable tuning, good action, and strong sound. You still need to disclose wear — just frame it honestly: “Shows play wear but sounds fantastic and has years of life left.”</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section">
      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>What’s Included Matters</h2>
      <p>List everything that comes with the guitar: the case, gig bag, tremolo arm, COA, manuals, tools, or extra parts. If the case is original, say so. If it’s aftermarket, describe it clearly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section">
      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Test Everything Before You List</h2>
      <p>Plug the guitar in and test every pickup position, tone/volume control, switch, and jack. Here at Coal Creek Guitars, we once shipped a Stratocaster that unfortunately we had failed to test before shipping out. The buyer discovered a broken push/pull knob on arrival, and a simple pre-listing test would have saved time, money, and extra shipping.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section">
      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Plan for Fixes if You’re Flipping</h2>
      <p>If you’re selling as-is, price accordingly. If you plan to fix things first, budget for the basics: strings, setup, a replacement switch, or upgraded tuners. Small repairs can unlock a higher price, but only if the margin still makes sense.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section">
      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Be Ready to Make It Right</h2>
      <p>Even with perfect prep, problems happen. If a buyer finds something you missed, handle it professionally. In the Stratocaster example above, we offered a full refund or a partial refund to cover the repair. The buyer chose the partial refund and still left a 5-star review because we acted quickly and fairly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section">
      <h2><span class="step-bullet" aria-hidden="true"></span>Your Reputation Sells the Guitar</h2>
      <p>Clear communication, honest listings, and polite responses build your seller reputation. After a successful sale, ask for a review — many buyers won’t leave one unless prompted.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="listing-section listing-final">
      <h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
      <p>Great listings come down to clarity: accurate specs, thorough photos, honest condition notes, and fast communication. Do those well, and you’ll sell faster and with fewer headaches.</p>
