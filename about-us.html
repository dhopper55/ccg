    <h1>About Coal Creek Guitars</h1>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Coal Creek Guitars was founded in 2017 in the foothills of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. What started as a passion project between lifelong players and enthusiasts has grown into a trusted destination for guitarists seeking quality instruments and honest expertise.</p>
      <p>Our owners have been immersed in the world of guitars for decades—playing, collecting, repairing, and appreciating the craftsmanship that goes into every great instrument. That deep-rooted love for guitars is at the heart of everything we do.</p>

      <h2>Colorado's Music Community</h2>
      <p>Colorado boasts one of the most vibrant and diverse music communities in the country. From the bluegrass festivals in Telluride to the thriving rock and indie scenes in Denver and Boulder, music is woven into the fabric of our state. Folk, country, jazz, metal, and everything in between—Colorado musicians bring an eclectic energy that inspires us every day.</p>
      <p>We're proud to be part of this community, serving players of all genres and skill levels who share our appreciation for the instrument that brings so much music to life.</p>

      <h2>Authenticity in the Age of AI</h2>
      <p>In an era increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence and digital automation, we find something deeply satisfying about working in a business built on authenticity. There's no algorithm that can replicate the feel of a well-worn neck, the resonance of aged tonewoods, or the personal connection between a player and their instrument.</p>
      <p>Every guitar has a story—where it was made, who played it, the music it helped create. We love being part of that story, connecting instruments with the people who will write their next chapter.</p>

      <h2>Supporting Music Education</h2>
      <p>We believe strongly in the power of music education. Learning to play an instrument at a young age develops creativity, discipline, and emotional expression in ways that benefit students throughout their lives. Music and art education aren't luxuries—they're essential parts of a well-rounded education.</p>
      <p>Coal Creek Guitars actively supports music programs in local schools because we believe every child deserves the opportunity to discover the joy of making music. When you do business with us, you're supporting that mission too.</p>
